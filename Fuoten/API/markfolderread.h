 * If a valid AbstractStorage object is set to the Component::storage property, AbstractStorage::folderMarkedRead() will be called in the successCallback() to
 * update the local storage. If the request succeeded, the MarkFolderRead::succeeded() signal will be emitted, containing the \a folderId and the \a newestItemId.
 * If something failed, the Component::failed() signal will be emitted and Component::error will contain a valid pointer to an Error object.
