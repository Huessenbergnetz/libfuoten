/*!
 * \brief Abstract class to implement platform specific notifications about errors and successful operations.
 *
 * Reimplement this class if you want to have notifications specific for your target platform. All API class
 * can notify about occured errors - but not about success. Sucess notifications should be done by the a storage
 * class derived from AbstractStorage, or separate from the API classes after processing the API results.
 *
 * \par Setting a notificator
 *
 * You can set a notificator via different methods. For all API classes there is the Component::notificator property,
 * the same is true for storage classes via the AbstractStorage::notificator property and for the synchronizer via
 * Synchronizer::notificator property. Beside these instance based properties there is also Component::setDefaultNotificator()
 * to set a global default notificator that is used if no notificator is set for the current object. If no notificator
 * has been set, there will be no notifications but programm will run normal. So notifications are totally optional.
 *
 * \par Creating a new notificator
 *
 * Notifications are platform dependent, so you should create notificators for your target platform by creating a
 * new class derived from AbstractNotificator. The main method for notifications you have to reimplement in your class
 * is notify(Type type, QtMsgType severity, const QVariant &data). This method handles all the default notifications
 * about occured errors and success notifications.
 *
 * When reimplementing the default notification method, you can use appIcon() and appName() to populate default fields,
 * optionally you can use isEnabled() to enable or disable notifications globally. You could for example disable notifications
 * if your application is currently active and visible to the user and there are places in the application that show the same
 * information. But it is on you how you implement it. You can also simply rely on the notification \a type and \a severity
 * to decide when and how to show notifications.
 *
 * Only the error notification \link AbstractNotificator::Type types \endlink will provide ready to display error strings
 * in the \a data argument. All other \link AbstractNotificator::Type types \endlink will have meta data in the \a data
 * argument that can be used to create custom notification messages. See the \link AbstractNotificator::Type type \endlink
 * enum description to learn what data you can expect for the different types.
 *
 * The \a severity argument is an additional hint for displaying the notifications. Most error \link AbstractNotificator::Type types \endlink
 * will have QtCriticalMsg as their \a severity, only a few will have QtFatalMsg, some other might have QtWarningMsg. Informational
 * notifications - like success notifications - will have a \a severity of QtInfoMsg.
